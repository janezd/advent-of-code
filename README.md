My solutions of tasks in [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com), a set of
programming exercises suitable for beginners (at least the first week or two),
learning new languages or remembering those you've forgot.

I started in several languages but didn't have time to proceed like this, so
most solutions are in Python. Some are interesting, though.
See [Spherical horses in bash](https://github.com/janezd/advent-of-code/blob/master/2015/03%20Spherical%20horses/solution.sh) or some [nice solutions of Some Assembly Required](https://github.com/janezd/advent-of-code/tree/master/2015/07%20Some%20Assembly%20Required),
for example.

Tasks include some NP-complete problems and other problems. No smart solutions
here, just pure brute force with minor optimizations. It is amazing how short
these solutions can be in Python, and how they still run fast enough.
