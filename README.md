My solutions of tasks in [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com), a set of
programming exercises suitable for beginners (at least the first week or two),
learning new languages or remembering those you've forgot.

### 2016

I first implemented solutions in Python to find the correct answer and sometimes already to prototype the C-style solutions. Next I implemented the solution in C ... and finally changed this into code that runs on Arduino.

Arduino code requires a 7-segment LED display with 8-digits, except for tasks that output text, where I used a two-line LCD display. A speaker for sound effects is connected to pin 2.

I posted videos of Arduino solving tasks to [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm-JYoU3uw-aIWvjuzHk2KOQSjLQT6Ac-).

### 2015

I started in several languages but didn't have time to proceed like this, so
most solutions are in Python. Some are interesting, though.
See [Spherical horses in bash](https://github.com/janezd/advent-of-code/blob/master/2015/03%20Spherical%20horses/solution.sh) or some [nice solutions of Some Assembly Required](https://github.com/janezd/advent-of-code/tree/master/2015/07%20Some%20Assembly%20Required),
for example.

Tasks include some NP-complete problems and other problems. No smart solutions
here, just pure brute force with minor optimizations. It is amazing how short
these solutions can be in Python, and how they still run fast enough.
